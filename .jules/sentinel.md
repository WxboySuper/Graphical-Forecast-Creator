## 2026-01-24 - [Stored XSS in Leaflet Tooltips]
**Vulnerability:** Found a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in `ForecastMap.tsx`. The `bindTooltip` method was being called with an HTML string constructed using the `probability` variable, which is derived from user input (loaded from localStorage or potential file imports). If a user loaded a manipulated forecast file, malicious scripts could execute when hovering over a map feature.
**Learning:** Leaflet's `bindTooltip` and `bindPopup` methods render HTML by default when passed a string. React's automatic escaping does not apply here because Leaflet manipulates the DOM directly.
**Prevention:** Always use `HTMLElement` (constructed via `document.createElement`) instead of HTML strings when using Leaflet's `bindTooltip` or `bindPopup` with dynamic data. Created `createTooltipContent` utility to enforce this pattern.
